# My cookbook exercises

This is an example repository for learning chef.

The repo contains the apache cookbook, which installs apache and creates a templated index.html according to role attributes.

The apache cookbook depends on the hello_world cookbook.

Additionally there is a the packages cookbook that installs python3 from the role attributes.

I defined the apache role to install the apache recipe and the packages recipe.
